Just making a website that plays music saved in the repository. I would like to have the songs as a list where people can click to add the songs to a queue.
Or something along those lines. 
The music that I'm going to use was written by a friend, although I have yet to talk to him to get permision, so I've add a couple folders containing public domain 
music from open game art. 

So this is the part where I admit that I don't know that much about github
