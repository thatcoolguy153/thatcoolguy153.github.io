mp4 player

Trying to make a page that plays songs from a library. This is my first time making a website, as well as my first time on github so I guess I don't know what I'm doing. My website doesn't even
work now, and I just added the music directories. I found a similar example: https://github.com/nioc/web-music-player, but I can't even figure out how to set that up
here. I doesn't have to be anywhere that complex yet btw. I'm trying to look at the examples to see if I can figure anything our, but I figure I would go ahead and do a pull request to see if that actually does anything.
